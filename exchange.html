	<p>2018-2019 is the most memorable year among the time I've spent in SKKU</br>
	So many things happened and I could mature through all the progress. </br>
	Let me list several huge events:</br>
		<ul>
			<li>Exchange student in UBC</li>
			<li>Love Failure</li>
			<li>Exam failure</li>
			<li>Return to Church</li>
			<li>Receiving 4.5 GPA</li>
			<li>Double Majoring CS</li>
		</ul>
	Some were awesome, but others were terrifying :(</br>
	BTW, I've cleared one of my bucketlists, "Getting a full mark GPA".</br>
	Anyways the happiest memories were all being in UBC. 
	UBC is a world-wide Top Ranked university located in Vancouver. 
	It offered so many charms that I would never forget for my whole life. 
	First, exchange life taught me how to become an Instagram master. 
	Sound pretty weird, but I bet many students, especially girls who've been on exchange 
	knows what I mean LOL. I've also written a long-winded English diary? on my Instagram 
	about thoughts of why I jumped into posting daily issues in such an open space.
	Umm, I still feel so embarrassed of that night, and let me show you a bit later. Just Wait! Haha.

	Next, so what I learned more? I became a perfect amateur cook! What a good news!!</br>
	Okay, well before I went to UBC, I had no need to cook for myself. Food was always prepared 
	for me indoors, outdoors, and anywhere. I did know how to make food, but I mean I was just 
	so unfamiliar and unskilled in the process.</br>  First, I was afraid of all the hot stuffs. </br>
	And second, I was threatened by the dangerous looking cooking utensils. </br>Most of all, 
	I wasn't confident in easily cooking my own food. Every steps seemed so complicated 
	which didn't seem like much of fun.</br>
	However, compared to my soft easy-going life in cozy homeland, living abroad was more like a 
	survival. I had to do everthing just by myself. I had to cook, clean, do the laundry, throw-away, 
	grocery shop, heal when I was ill, and ask if I'm not sure of something all by myself.</br>
	I could feel how dependent I used to be being home, and how much care and support I used to 
	receive for all my past years. So instead, I tried my best to become independent, which taught me 
	so many lessons. All my friends were in similar circumstances so we helped each other.</br>
	This ended up to make us become family and I miss every every one of them so hardly. 
	And everybody ended up to be great chefs, possible to clear even complicated foods. The photo 
	on the left-side proves our effort. Unfortunately, again I don't cook that often anymore, once 
	I've returned to Korea.

	<p>
	At last, UBC taught me how to get along with people with different thoughts, cultures, races, 
	and looks. Canada, as many already knows well, is a country mixed up with so many cultures. Therefore, 
	those people know how to understand others just the way they are.</br>To be honest, I was a terribly 
	stereotyped kind of person, so at first I had trouble communicating or being interested in others' 
	thoughts and interests. Especially, I couldn't understand how my flatmates could do parties so late 
	at night in my flat, even without my permission. At first, I felt disturbed of those party people and had to 
	escaped to my other friend's room for a better sleep. But, afterwards, I learned how to join those parties 
	and learned that it was just their own way to get socialized and hangout with friends.</br>
	In Korea, many restuarants or bars are opened during night time. So we usually hangout outdoors at nights. 
	But things were different in Vancouver. People host parties indoors and share thrilling moments with 
	close friends in private areas. And those parties turned out to be huge fun!
